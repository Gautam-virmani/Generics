            <p>With over 14 million collective streams to date, Vancouver has continued to work tirelessly to cement there place in the American country music landscape. Nominated for the 2019 CCMA “Rising Star” Award in addition to presenting on the national CCMA Awards broadcast, we have big things coming in 2021, starting with our latest single “Send It My Way”, available now. “Send It My Way”, penned by Andrew Dorff (Blake Shelton, Kenny Chesney), Matt Dragstrem (Florida Georgia Line, Justin Moore) and Josh Osborne (Sam Hunt, Keith Urban) is a summery feel-good track and follows the previously released “The Little Things” and “What Do I Know”, his second Top 10 hit. Austin was recently a season two finalist on NBC’s Songland, pitching Florida Georgia Line as a songwriting contestant in the ground-breaking series that puts undiscovered songwriters at center stage as they pitch their original creations to top recording artists and a panel of chart-topping music producers, in hopes of creating the artists’ next big hits. With magnetic vocals, honest lyricism and an overall laid-back vibe often compared to a hybrid of country superstar Brett Eldridge and Grammy-winning icon John Mayer, Austin shows no sign of slowing down in 2020.</p>
